Multi-platform Autonomous Swarming Simulation Common Open-source Tools Suite

EpiSci is pleased to plant the seeds for “MASSCOTS: Massive Autonomous Swarming Simulation Common Open-source Tools Suite” with the goal of manifesting an open, common environment to design, develop, and demonstrate a wide range of teaming concepts to the autonomous flight domain with seamless support for machine learning (ML). MASSCOTS is being built on severa open source tools in multiple domains such as machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, teaming, dynamic network formation, swarming, wireless networking, and flight simulators. Specifically, MASSCOTS will establish an ability to share and reproduce research results across multiple organizations to engage in sophisticated machine learning experiments. Moreover, MASSCOTS is being designed to support scalability to large-scale swarms and extensibility to accommodate the latest deep learning algorithms and tools.

All of the MASSCOTS source codes available here have no restrictions. 

This repository is work in progress. Included here is a baseline code of the “gym-CORE” interface code that realizes the connection betwee the world of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and the world of networks emulated by CORE (http://github.com/coreemu/core) with full conformance to OpenAI Gym. More codes will be upload themselves automatically once they sprout in the future :)

Simulation experiment tools for deep learning that inspired MASSCOTS include: MuJoCo mujoco.org, a physics engine for robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation research; and PyGame Learning Environment https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest, a Python learning environment for reinforcement learning mimicking Arcade Learning Environment.
