Multi-platform Autonomous Swarming Simulation Common Open-source Tools Suite

The Team of EpiSys Science, Inc. (EpiSci) and Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) is pleased to plant the seeds for “MASSCOTS: Massive Autonomous Swarming Simulation Common Open-source Tools Suite” with the goal of manifesting an open, common environment to design, develop, and demonstrate a wide range of teaming concepts to the autonomous flight domain with seamless support for machine learning (ML). MASSCOTS will be built on severa open source tools in multiple domains such as machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, teaming, dynamic network formation, swarming, wireless networking, and flight simulators. Specifically, MASSCOTS will establish an ability to share and reproduce research results across multiple organizations to engage in sophisticated machine learning experiments. All of the MASSCOTS source codes will be public-released with no restrictions. MASSCOTS supports scalability to large-scale swarms and extensibility to accommodate the latest deep learning algorithms and tools.

This repository is work in progress. Included here is gym-CORE interface code that connects deep reinforcement learning with CORE/EMANE network emulation, which conforms to OpenAI Gym. More codes will upload themselves automatically once they sprout in the future :)

Simulation experiment tools for deep learning that inspired MASSCOTS include: MuJoCo mujoco.org, a physics engine for robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation research; and PyGame Learning Environment https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest, a Python learning environment for reinforcement learning mimicking Arcade Learning Environment
